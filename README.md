# SURFS UP CHALLENGE

## Project Overview
The purpose of this projecct is to analyze the temperature in Oahu for the months of June and December to determine the tempreature
trends before opening the Surfs Ups shop.  These two month are being used as a point of reference to determine if the shops is viable
all year round.  


## Analysis of June Temperature Trends:
- The mean temperature for June is 74.94 degrees.  
- The low temperature for June was 64 degrees.
- The high temperature for June was 85 degrees.

## Analysis of December Temperature Trends:
- The mean temperature for December is 71.04 degrees.  
- The low temperature for December was 56 degrees.
- The high temperature for December was 83 degrees.

## RESULTS SUMMARY & RECOMMENDATIONS
- Given the limitations of running only a temperature query for the months of June and December, my recommendation may lack 
  enough depth to be given with a high level of confidence.  However within these constraints, we can safely make the assumption 
  that the temperature in Oahu is consistant enough throughout the year to make the opening of this ice cream shop a viable 
  decision.  It is my recommendation to move ahead with the store opening.
- In order to make a more informed recommendation, I would advise we run additional statistical analysis on 
  precipitation for the months of June and December.  Additionally, it would be advisable to run a further query on March
  and Septemeber, to get a clearer picture of the year round temperature and rainful.  Having 4 data point for reference 
  will enable our interpolation between the period to be much more accurate.
